Project 3 pt 1 - Android Nanodegree

In this project, I productionized one of two apps, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. 
To do this, I found and handled error cases and added a library.

## Build/Install
none

## Components

Implemented:
* AddedBarcode scanning functionality via library.
* Handled internet-connectivity related crashes.
